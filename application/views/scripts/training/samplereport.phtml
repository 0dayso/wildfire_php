“I am so glad that Sergeant Major store in Huaihai Parkson opened. I went there last Friday and saw the clerks with special hats in the elevator between 6th and 7th floor. Those are not made of straw nor very light. They were made of jeans- thick and heavy. But since the hat’s color is bright (yellow in the front of hat and green in the back) and the feather is red, the kids never took them off of their heads. The clothes Sergeant major sells are for children younger than 7 years old, but I think it was a bit too large for my kids since this brand is European. However, I still bought a coat with a removable lining for my boy and a pink wind coat for my baby girl. To my surprise, the staff gave me a gift- a cat toy that can be painted. I was rally happy about it. The staff also told me that I can bring my kids to the store to measure their height and take pictures with the VIP card, and those will be uploaded on the official website! I even told my friends back home to visit Sergeant Major store. Thanks Wildfire for holding this activity, which makes me love Sergeant Major.” --- Wang Feng, 32 years old.

“I talked with my friend, Zhu Hong Xia, before she went to the event. She said she already saw the product at the grocery store and tried it for free. She thought it tasted good but the price is a little bit expensive compared to the other brands. If the price is one Chinese Renminbi lower or at least the same as the other brands then she would definitely choose it over the rest. I hope you can relay her comments to Kraft Foods so more consumers will buy the product because it is really a good one!” --- Wang Shuaijun, 28 years old.
